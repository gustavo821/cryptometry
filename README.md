# Cryptometry

## Description
A desktop interface displaying cryptocurrency pricing, trends, and market caps using node, react.js, redux, axios, electron, coinmarketcap API, and cryptocompare.com API

## To-Do List for initial release
  1. [IN PROGRESS] Complete Wireframe
  2. [IN PROGRESS] Complete UI design
  3. [IN PROGRESS] Integrate top market cap coins list into main component
  4. [TO DO] Add additional view filters to toggle data display & change currency pairs
  5. [TO DO] Add highcharts.js for viewing data
  6. [TO DO] Add customizable user settings
  7. [TO DO] Integrate react-router for additional routes
  8. [TO DO] Integrate into desktop wrapper (Electron)

## [IN PROGRESS] Wireframe
Here's the idea for the general layout / positioning for the app. Some of the UI Elements have been designed and finalized along with font selection. Additional views are still to be added, and there's no doubt some routes / components missing from this preliminary wireframe.

## [IN PROGRESS] User Interface
This needs to be updated to reflect the wireframe, and will not be until the wireframe is finalized.
